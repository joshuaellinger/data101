This project is for teaching Sam and his friends the basics of programming and game development.

D&D Monster files is sourced from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sccR7HgoHGB0Mq24k5K-O-tqJZG8D3Z66Ig7UloukNY/edit?pli=1&gid=2073157549#gid=2073157549

After show some basic data manipulation logic, we switched over to building a simple D&D 1-on-1 monster fight engine.

To run it, run type "python LoadMonsters.py".  It reads the two monsters defined in MonsterStats.json and makes them fight until one is dead.

Current implementaiton lacks critical hits, and saving throws.
