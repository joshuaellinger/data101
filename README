This project is for teaching Sam and his friends the basics of programming and game development.

RESOURCES:

D&D Monster files is sourced from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sccR7HgoHGB0Mq24k5K-O-tqJZG8D3Z66Ig7UloukNY/edit?pli=1&gid=2073157549#gid=2073157549

For pygame (the GUI platform), look at https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/ and
   https://www.pygame.org/docs/

CODE:

1. Sam's main monster fight is in LoadMonsters.py.  To run it, run type "python LoadMonsters.py".  It reads the two monsters defined in MonsterStats.json and makes them fight until one is dead.

2. Amelia's gui first-steps is GUI_Events.py.  This is just the start of a description of what the GUI needs from the engine to run.  It will eventually be replaced by a pygame mail loop.

3. Ruby's fight management codes is fight_setup.py.  This is just a placeholder with instructions about what she needs do to get ready to run a fight.

4. Josh's tracking logic is in students.py.  This is where I am show new python stuff under the guise of 'taking attendence'. 

5. Josh's pygame samples are in code_examples/pygame_hello_world.py.  To run them:
    pip install pygame
    python/python3 ./code_examples/pygame_hello_world.py
